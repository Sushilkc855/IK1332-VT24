# IK1332-VT24
The iot project of implementing a pico netwrok using BLE and raspberry pis 
 
 1 Background
An easy, cheap way to test different connectivity solutions is Raspberry pi single board computers. They
contain Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and Wifi 802.11ac transceiver circuits as well as USB, Ethernet
and HDMI connections. It is also possible to add, for example, additional boards (HAT) for LoRa
transceiver circuits.
2 Project Components
This project consists of designing and implementing a sensor network for monitoring an office
environment using necessary sensors and Raspberry Pi computers. The goal of the sensor network is to
measure the different features at different locations such as temperature and humidity and present that
on a webpage. The exact implementation of communication protocol and server technology is left as a
task for the student group to resolve.
Start with the following:
• Select the appropriate sensors to be used in your application.
• Study references to build a point-to-point link between two Raspberry Pis.
• Test the sensors on one Raspberry Pi.

Task: 
• Set up a pico-network using BLE, that collects application data from slave-nodes and transmit
that to the master-node.
• Present application data regularly on a computer display
